One of the disadvantages of using the if then statement without a code block(curly braces), is that itÂ´s not immediately clear
what the code is actually doing.]

boolean isAlien = false;

if(isAlien = false)
    System.out.println("It is not an alien!");
    System.out.println("And I am scared of aliens!");


output: And I am scared of aliens

The reason for that is, without the code block, only the line immediately following the if then statement can be added.


if(isAlien = false)
    System.out.println("It is not an alien!");
    System.out.println("And I am scared of aliens!");

    Instead of using the if statement as we can see here, we should use a code block.

    A code block allows more than one statement
     to be executed, in other words, a block of code.



     if (expression){

     }
