Inheritance vs Composition

    - Inheritance defines an IS A relationship
    
    - Composition defines a HAS A relationship.


Next, let´s see how we´de use composition to create a personal computer.

    - PersonalComputer inherits from Product.

    - But a PersonalComputer, in addition to being a product, is actually made up of other parts.

    - The computer has a motherboard, a case, and a monitor.

    - The motherboard, the computer case, and the monitor aren´t computers, not in the same sense that they´re products.

    - So, that´s what composition is, it´s actually modelling parts, and those parts make up a greater whole.

    - In this case, we´re gonna model the personal computer.
