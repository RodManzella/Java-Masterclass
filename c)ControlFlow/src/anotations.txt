The switch statement

Switch(value){
    case x:
        //code for value x
        break,

    case y:
        // code for value y
        break;
    default:
        // code for value not equal to x or y
}

Another important thing to know, is that the switch statement can only be used with a limited type of variable data types.


Valid Switch Value types:

----------------------------
byte, short, int, char

Byte, Short, Integer, Character

String

enum
-------------------------------

important: Cannot use long, float, double or boolean or their wrappers.


Fall through in switch statement

Once a switch case label matches the switch variable, no more cases are checked.

Any code after the case label where there was a match found, will be executed, until a break statement, or the end
of the switch statement occurs.

Without a break statement, execution will continue to fall through any case labels declared below the matching one, and
execute each caseÂ´s code.
