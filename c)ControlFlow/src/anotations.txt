The switch statement

Switch(value){
    case x:
        //code for value x
        break,

    case y:
        // code for value y
        break;
    default:
        // code for value not equal to x or y
}

Another important thing to know, is that the switch statement can only be used with a limited type of variable data types.


Valid Switch Value types:

----------------------------
byte, short, int, char

Byte, Short, Integer, Character

String

enum
-------------------------------

important: Cannot use long, float, double or boolean or their wrappers.


Fall through in switch statement

Once a switch case label matches the switch variable, no more cases are checked.

Any code after the case label where there was a match found, will be executed, until a break statement, or the end
of the switch statement occurs.

Without a break statement, execution will continue to fall through any case labels declared below the matching one, and
execute each caseÂ´s code.

More switch statement

since JDK 9, the switch has been undergoing enhancements, but to keep it backwars compatible, Java has introduced a new syntax
for the switch as shown below:

Traditional Swicth statement:

switch(switchValue){  //check the variable switchValue
    case 1:                                              
        System.out.println("Value was 1");
        break;  
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Values was 2");
        break;
    case 3: case 4: case 5:                           
        System.out.println("Was a 3, a 4 or a 5");
        System.out.println("Actually, it was a "+switchValue);
    default:
        System.out.println("Was not 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5");  
        }


Enhanced switch statement:

switch(switchValue){
    case 1 -> System.out.println("Value was 1");
    case 2 -> System.out.println("Value was 2");
    case 3, 4, 5 ->{
        System.out.println("Was a 3, a 4 or a 5");
        System.out.println("Actually, it was a "+switchValue);
    }
    default -> System.out.println("Was not 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5");  
}
