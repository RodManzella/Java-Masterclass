public class DigitSumChallenge {
    // In this challenge, your task is to write a method, with the name sumDigits, that has a single parameter
    // named number of type int, and it should return an int.

    // The method should only take a number that is a positive number.
    // If a negative number is passed, it should return -1, meaning an invalid value was passed.
    //The method should parse out each digit from the number, and sum the digits up.
    
    // So if 125 is the value passed to the method, the code should sum each digit, in this case, 1 + 2 + 5, and return int 8.
