Generalization and Abstraction

        - We use the terms Abstraction and Generalization, when we start trying to model real world things in software.

        - When you start modelling objects for your application, you start by identifying what features and behaviour your objects
          have in common

        - We generalize when we create a class hierarchy

        - A base class is the most general class, the most basic building block, which everything can be said to have in common

    
Abstraction

        - Part of generalizing is using Abstraction.

        - You can generalize a set of characteristics and behavior into an abstract type.

        - If you considerar an octopus, a dog, and a penguin, you would probably say they are all animals.

        - An animal is really an abstract concept.

        - An animal doesn´t really exist, except as a way to describe a set of more specific things

        - If you can´t draw it on a piece of paper, it´s probably abstract.

        - Abstraction simplifies the view of a set of items, traits and behaviour, so we can talk about them as a group,
          as well as generalize their functionality.
