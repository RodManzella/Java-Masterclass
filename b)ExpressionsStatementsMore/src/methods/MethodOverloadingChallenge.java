    //The first method has one parameter of type int, which represents the entire height in inches. YouÂ´ll convert inches to centimeters
    //in this method and pass back the number of centimeters, as a double.

    //The second method has two parameters of type int, one to represent height in feet, and other to represent the remaining height in inches.
    //So if a person is 5 foot and 8 inches, the value is 5 for feet and 8 for inches would be passes to this method. This method will convert
    // feet and inches to just inches, then call the first, also returning the value as a double.

    // Both methods should return a real number or decimal value for total height in centimeters.
    // Call both methods, and print out the results.
    
    // The conversion formula from inches to centimeters is 1 inch = 2.54cm.

    //Also remember that 1 foot = 12 inches.
