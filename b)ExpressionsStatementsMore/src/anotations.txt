Keywords and expresisons

Java has actually got 51 reserved words, that are used for keywords in your applications.

A keyword is one of the 51 reserved words, that have a predefined meaning in the language.

Java actually uses the terminology character sequences to describe these now.

In addition to reserved keywords you´ll see that as of JDK 17, Java has 16 contextual keywords, which are only keywords
in special situations.

Methods recap


-Java´s documentation states that: 

A method calls executable code that can be invoked, passing a fixed number of values as arguments.

Like some of the abbreviated operators we learned about, a method can be a statement or an expression in some instances.

Any method can be executed as a statement.

A method that returns a value can be used as an expression, or as part of any expression.


What are functions and procedures?

- Some programming languages will call a method that returns a value, a function, and a method that doesn´t return a value, a procedure.

 - You´ll often hear function and method used interchangeably in Java.

 The term procedure is somewhat less common, when applied to Java methods, but you may still hear a method with a void return type,
 called procedure.

- Declaring the method

So there are quite a few declarations that need to occur as we create a method.

This consists of:

Declaring Modifiers. These are keywords in Java with special meanings, we´ve seen public and static examples, but there are others.


- Declaring the return type.

void is a Java keyword meaning no data is returned from a method.

Alternatively, the return type can be any primitive data type or class.

If a return type is defined, the code block must use at least one return statement, returning a value, of the declared type operators
comparable type.



- Declaring the method

Declaring the method name. lower camel case is recommended for method names.

Declaring the method paramethers in parentheses. A method is not required to have parameters, so a set of empty parenthesis would
be declared in that case.

Declaring the method with opening and closing curly braces. this is also called the method body.



- Declaring the parameters

Parameters are declared as a list of comma-separated specifiers, each of which has a parameter type and a parameter name (or identifier).

Parameter order is important when calling the method.

The calling code must pass arguments to the method, with the same or comparable type, and in the same order, as the declaration.

The calling code must pass the same number of arguments, as the number of parameters declared.
