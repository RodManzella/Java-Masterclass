public class FirstClass{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Hello World");

       /*   -the public Java keyword is what´s called an acess modifier.

            - An acess modifier alows us to define which parts of our code, or even someone else´s code
                can acess a particular element.

            - The class keyword is used to define a class, and the class name will be the next following
                the keyword, so FirstClass in this case.

            - Also notice the left and right curly braces({}) they are used to define the class code block, or
                the class body.

            - So to define a class, it requires an optional acess modifier to start and in this case we´ve used the public
                followed by the keyword class, then the class name(FirstClass) and finally followed by the left and right curly
                braces that define the class body

            - Anything inside that body is considered part of this class. Within a class, we can have data and code.

            - We also see that we have a main method to this class to print out our hello world message. But first, what
                is a method?

            - A method is a collection of statements, one or more, that perform an operation.

            - We´ll be using a special method called the main method, that java looks for when running a program.

            - It´s the entry point for any Java code, and Java looks for the main method to start and run the program
                when we use it.

            - You can also create your own methods.
