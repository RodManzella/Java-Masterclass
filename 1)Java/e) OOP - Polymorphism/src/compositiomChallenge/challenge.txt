In this challenge, you need to create an application for controlling a smart kitchen.

Your smart kitchen will have several appliances.

Your appliances will be Internet Of Things (IoT) devices, which can be programmed.

It´s your job to write the code, to enable your smart kitcfhen application, to execute certain jobs.

Methods on your smartKitchen class, will determine what work needs to be done:

.addWater() will set the Coffee Maker´s hasWorkToDo field to true.

.pourMilk() will set Refrigerator´s hasWorkToDo to true.

.loadDishWasher() will set the hasWorkToDo to true, on that appliance.


To execute the work needed to be done by the appliances, you´ll implement this in two ways:
    
    - First, your application will acess each appliance(by using a getter), and execute a method.

    - The applicane methods are orderFood() on Refrigerator, doDishes() on DishWasher, and brewCoffee() on CoffeeMaker.

    - These methods should check the hasWorkToDo flag, and if true, print a message out, about what work is being done.


    - Second, your application won´t acess the appliances directly.
    - it should call doKitchenWork(), which delegates the work, to any of its appliances.
