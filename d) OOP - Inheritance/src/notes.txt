What is object oriented programming

    - Object oriented programming is a way to model real world objects, as software objects, which contain both data and code.

    - OOP is a common acronym for Object Oriented programming

Class-based programming

    - Class-based programming starts with classes, which become blueprints for objects.


State and Behaviour

    - Now, real world objects have two major coomponents: (state and behaviour)

    - State, in terms of a computer object, might be: The amout of RAM it has, the operating system it´s running, the hard drive size.

    - These are characteristics about the item, that can describe it.

    - Behaviour(computer): In addition to state, objects may also have a behaviour, or actions that can be performed by the object or upon the
      object. Behaviour, for a computer, might be things like: booting up, shuting down, outputing some form of sound, drawing something on the
      screen and so son.

    - So modelling real world objects as software objects, is a fundamental part of Object Oriented Programming.

    - Now, a software object stores its state in fields, which can also be called variables, or attributes.

    - And objects expose their behaviour with methods, which we-ve talked about before.

    - So, where does a class fit in?

    - Well, think of a class as a template, or blueprint for creating objects.

The class as the blueprint

    - The class describes the data(fields), and the behaviour (methods), that are relevant to the real world object we want to describe.

    - These are called class members.

    - A class member can be a field, or a method, or some other type of dependant element.

    - If a field is static, there is only one copy in memory, and this value is associated with the class, or template itself.

    - If a field is not static, it´s called an instance field, and each object may have a different value stored for this field.

    - A static method can´t be dependant on any one object´s state, so it can´t reference any instance members.

    - In other words, any method that operates on instance fields, needs to be non-static.
