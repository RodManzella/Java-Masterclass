// Using extends specifies the superclass (or the parent class) of the class we´re declaring.
// We can say Dog is a subclass, or child class, of animal.
// We can say Animal is a parent, or super class, of Dog.
// A class can specify one, and only one class in it extends clause.

// You´ll remember we used the keyword this, followed by parentheses and parameters, as a way to call another constructor in the same class.
// Well, super parentheses is similar to that. It´s a way to call the constructor on the parent class, or super class. Here, we´re calling
// Animal´s constructor by using the keyword super, and then parentheses
