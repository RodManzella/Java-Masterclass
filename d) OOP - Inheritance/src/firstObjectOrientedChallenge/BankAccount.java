public class BankAccount {
    
    
}

// Create a new class for a bank account.

// Create fields for account characteristics like:
    //account number
    //account balance
    //customer name
    //email
    //phone number

// Create getters and settes for each field.
// create two additional methods:
    //one for depositing funds into the account
    //one for withdrawing funds from the account

// A customer should not be allowed to withdraw funds, if that withdrawal takes their balance negative.
// YouÂ´ll create an instance of account class, and then test your withdrawal and deposit methods.
